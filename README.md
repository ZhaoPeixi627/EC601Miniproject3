In python there are many libraries and modules which can help to learn and understand Digital Signal Processing. I'll give a brief introduction to these tools.
Tool：Python 3.7
Libaries: 
** QT5
** numpy
** scipy
** matplotlib
1. Numpy
Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.Plot the window and its frequency response:

2. Scipy
SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

3.Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook,google Colab,jupyter lab, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.
