In python there are many libraries and modules which can help to learn and understand Digital Signal Processing. I'll give a brief introduction to these tools.
Tool：Python 3.7
Libaries: 
** QT5
** numpy
** scipy
** matplotlib
1. Numpy
Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. Besides its obvious scientific uses, NumPy can also be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined. This allows NumPy to seamlessly and speedily integrate with a wide variety of databases.Plot the window and its frequency response:

2. Scipy
SciPy (pronounced “Sigh Pie”) is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering.

3. Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and IPython shells, the Jupyter notebook,google Colab, jupyter lab, web application servers, and four graphical user interface toolkits.

Pros of Using Python:
** It’s a beautiful, widely used language. Array numbering starts from 0, the language syntax is much better thought out, as is the class system. The module/packaging system in Python is much better than MATLAB’s path. And I happen to like iterators and generators in Python, which aren’t in MATLAB.
** Matplotlib is like MATLAB’s plotting utility, but improved and easier to use.
** You get all the nifty Python libraries as well. Opening files, iterating over directories, etc. is all easier.
** If you want a MATLAB-like environment, you can use the IPython (interactive Python) shell, which includes goodies like tab-completion, debugging-on-error, and “notebooks” to record your exploration.
**  The numpy/scipy/pandas libraries are comparable to MATLAB plus a bunch of toolboxes. For instance, I was recently able to work with some cubic-spline-fitting functions of scipy. I wouldn’t have been able to do the same thing in MATLAB unless I had the Curve-Fitting Toolbox.
